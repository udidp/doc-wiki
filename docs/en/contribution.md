# Contribution <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

Click the github icon in the upper right corner of this article to view this project. There is also a link to `edit this article` at the bottom of each page, click to jump to github for editing.

The outline directory of this book is controlled by the project team members, and the content of the article can be edited freely. The main line of this book is based on practicality, and only provides a simple and concise installation line that we think is currently better. Redundant and meaningless content will not be accepted.

The addition of project resources, such as images, non-essential js files, and non-essential css files, are not accepted. Because of the blockade and restrictions on github in some countries, such files under direct connection will greatly slow down the loading speed of web pages.
